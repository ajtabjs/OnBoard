# AJ's swag NFC business card

This is a simple business card with NFC functionality made with a Hack Club tutorial.

This will simply be used to tell others about my skills as a web developer and other things.
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
I'm getting a minimum of 5 cards so 

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
